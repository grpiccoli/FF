\title{Plot histogram}
\usage{
plotHist(obj, ids = NULL, macrostands = NULL, plot = TRUE,
  subset = 25, points.after = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{FullSimulation} object generated by the \code{\link[fpfi3]{FullSimulation}} function.}

\item{ids}{A vector of idg to plot. Is the 'idg' column of the "main" parameter in the list returned by the BatchGrowing function. Default is NULL (first 9 ploted)}

\item{macrostands}{A vector of names.}

\item{plot}{if TRUE, the plot will be displayed. Default is TRUE.}

\item{subset}{A number, indicating the maximum number of plots to display (to avoid saturation). Default value is 25 (5x5 grid).}

\item{points.after}{An integer, indicating how many years after the thinning to plot (usually to compare). Default is 0 (no plot).}
}
\value{
A plot, where grey is the pre-thinned distribution, blue is the thinned distribution and red is the after-thinning distribution of trees.
If \code{points.after != 0}, the distribution will appear in green.
}
\description{
Plot the histogram of the thinned vs harvested vs total.
}
\details{
A maximum of 16 plots are allowed in one single call.

# Let's use the data loaded inside this package:

taper_coeffs  # See ?taper_coeffs for a detailed description.
demo_products  # See ?demo_products for a detailed description.

# Running the simulation
